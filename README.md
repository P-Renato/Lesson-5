# PRB - 05:

**PREVIOUSLY**
- Arrays and Objects

**TODAY**
- File I/O
- Handling errors

## File I/O

- Inputs and Outputs (or I/O) is an important skill
- There are many different concepts and ways of working with I/O
- Let's learn a simple example of File I/O
- We will again learn this technique without going into the details

- We will again use the "import" keyword
- What did we use it for before today?

- What does the "fs" mean?
    - Filesystem

- How is the import different this time from the time we used prompts?
    - We didn't need to `npm install` anything
    - That is because `fs` is actually built into node
